\chapter*{Objective}
When I began experimenting with RUBBoS on Emulba, I quickly discovered that there were some limitations. There are a limited number of machines, and often times I ended up unable to run my experiments due to these limited resources. An alternative was needed.

This is were Amazon's Elastic Compute Cluster (EC2) has been remarkably useful. Virtual instances are sold by the hour, and are available in a multitude of hardware configurations. The challenge with these instances is that they begin as blank slates that lack any of the configuration that the RUBBoS scripts need to run. This is the objective of this project; To create an environment that allows EC2 to be used as a viable alternative to Emulab.
